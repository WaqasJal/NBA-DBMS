# Basketball Leaugue DBMS

The NBA (national basketball association) provides entertainment to over 15.1 million people across the world. This league consists of 30 teams playing top notch basketball. In this assignment we created our own basketball league to simulate statistics similar to real NBA stats.

## Concluding Remarks

Working on this basketball league management database has provided us with a solid foundation in database design and implementation. With the theories we learned regarding entity-relationship diagrams, relational schema design, functional dependencies, normalization, etc., we were able to turn various pieces of data into a useful and accessible database that anyone can access.
